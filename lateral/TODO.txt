NOTE: best model so far: pathplanner_BS16_lr1e-5_07-09-23 + combomodel_BS16_lr1e-5_11-09-23

- cleanup runs and models, remove failed or useless experiments
- switch between Linear and MDN MTP-layer

- either set lr=1e-7 for more epochs or add more model parameters (or less?)
- custom_collate for crossroads + train ComboModel
- custom plot epoch training and evaluation losses to check for overfitting

- optimize MDN, underfitting
- train PathPlanner and ComboModel with MDN
- custom_collatemultiple frames as well

- test and debug MDN after studying it better first
- if MDN doesn't work, try laplacian_nll_loss (probably already using it) or dstill_loss(kl_div_loss)
- study comma.ai stack better

- fix NaN problem with multiple workers (TEMPHACK)
- (optimization-optional) MultiVideoDataset: pseudo-normalize trajectory and get only 50 points from the 200 of trajectory (like ADA)

#===============================

- make a release
*merge cnn_dev with mdn_dev
*merge master with cnn_dev
*better README (+ docs?)
*tidy up project

#===============================

FUTURE MDOEL PREDICTIONS:
* lead_car + lead_car_prob
* pose
* (?) lane_lines, road_edges

#=====================================================================================================

- try lr=1e-6 for MDN net, loss <= 4.5!!!  (DONE)
- label crossroads for highway driving data (91+) (DONE)
- make path prediction => <xy_points,prob> => <[pi,sigma,mean], pob> (MDN)  (DONE)
- FIX: right turns, make desire more important? (model mostly wants to go left, needs more data) (DONE)
- train ComboModel on new data  (DONE)
- evaluate after each epoch and log that  (DONE)
- retrain PathPlanner with lr=1e-5 (if 1e-3 is not good enough) (DONE)
- revert back and CNN and make switching seamless (DONE)
- optimize speed using this [ https://efficientdl.com/faster-deep-learning-in-pytorch-a-guide/ ]  (DONE)
- add learning rate scheduler (DONE)
- lr=1e-4 more epochs (maybe add weight_decay)  (DONE)
- if that doesn't work add more GRU layers (in general try to overfit if possible)  (DONE)
- 5 path plans instead of 3 (DONE)
- generalize onnx exporter for PathPlanner and SuperComboModel  (DONE)
