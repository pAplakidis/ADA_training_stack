- revert back and CNN and make switching seamless (DONE)
- fix right turns (model mostly wants to go left, needs more data)
- make path prediction => <xy_points,prob> => <mean,std,prob>
- more work on basic CNN (works better than RNN for now)

- optimize speed using this [ https://efficientdl.com/faster-deep-learning-in-pytorch-a-guide/ ]  (DONE)
- add learning rate scheduler (DONE)
- lr=1e-4 more epochs (maybe add weight_decay)  (DONE)
- if that doesn't work add more GRU layers (in general try to overfit if possible)  (DONE)
