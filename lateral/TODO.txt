- FIX: right turns (model mostly wants to go left, needs more data) (DONE?)

- train ComboModel on new data (label crossroads first)
- evaluate after each epoch and log that

- make path prediction => <xy_points,prob> => <mean,sigma,prob>
- more work on basic CNN (works better than RNN for now)

- (optimization-optional) MultiVideoDataset: pseudo-normalize trajectory and get only 50 points from the 200 of trajectory (like ADA)

- retrain PathPlanner with lr=1e-5 (if 1e-3 is not good enough) (DONE)
- revert back and CNN and make switching seamless (DONE)
- optimize speed using this [ https://efficientdl.com/faster-deep-learning-in-pytorch-a-guide/ ]  (DONE)
- add learning rate scheduler (DONE)
- lr=1e-4 more epochs (maybe add weight_decay)  (DONE)
- if that doesn't work add more GRU layers (in general try to overfit if possible)  (DONE)
- 5 path plans instead of 3 (DONE)
- generalize onnx exporter for PathPlanner and SuperComboModel  (DONE)
